# DISQUS

> A platform for connecting students and faculty in our college. 
Users can create an account using college mail only and may post their projects, doubts or propose new ideas. 
Users can also post a doubt anonymously in case they are afraid to ask a doubt in public. 
This website will aid students in their overall growth and educate them about current curricular advancements, among other things.
Students can also message their faculty through our chat feature.
